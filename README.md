# vitoguideProtractor
Vitoguide demo application tests with tools Protractor and framework Jasmine.

In order to run the tests use the command: 
 
 protractor conf.js
 
 unfortunately the test, has a problem locating the button in the shadow DOM. 
 I've tried several ways to locate this button, but still without success.
 
 To continue the test, click the button approving cookies after starting the test.// very important
 
 After the tests are completed, the console displays the results of each test. 
 Additionally, you can check the screenshots that are available thanks to the 'protractor-beautiful-reporter'
